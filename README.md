# Roosevelt Panel Discussion on Economic Justice and the American Dream 

From the program brochure:

"Panelists will discuss the role of economic justice in the American Dream. Since the country's earliest days, Americans have generally been interested in maximizing opportunity, even if it comes at the expense of equality. This panel will explores the balance between competing claims of equality and opportunity."
