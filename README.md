# Roosevelt Economic Justice and the American Dream 

My talk will be data driven.

Interesting things to exam:

Buffets claim: corporate tax vs health care costs (2% vs 17% of GDP)

Raising the floor: jobs outsourced by automation

Home ownership percentage decline, nyt article.


## Updates

Talk about recovery and how so many people are still not working.
Unemployment statistics are based on the idea that over a certain amount
of time, people have dropped out of the workforce. While this might have been
a reasonable assumption in the past, the recovery is the first not to come back
to it's trend line. Look at how its lagged, model a chart based on Mason's work.

Home ownership has dropped as well. Chart of that.

Fiscal policy could help, but corporate american could help too.
Instead, they've grown profits largley by reducing costs and buying back shares.
Look at Janis work, show some charts again of corporate activity and why pointing to
the stock market is not quite the right statistic.

Also, GDP, while is up overall, its based on the price and quanitty of those good,
not based on the quality. In fact, it doesn not consider quality at all.

Higher education is still a path to achieving the American Dream.
Of these, technology is growing very fast. shows some charts here.
